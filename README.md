## About
This is the source code of my blog site built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I don't use any submodules for themes on my website, instead, I have all the `static` and `layouts` in 
the root directory of the project. Though the layouts have been copied and customised from a Hugo theme mentioned in [credits](#credits-and-licensing).

## Credits and licensing 
The theme used for this project was adopted from [hello-friend-ng](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/).

This project is licensed under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/santacodes/santacodes.github.io/blob/main/LICENSE) and has adopted the same license as the past
owners and modifiers of this [theme](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/).
