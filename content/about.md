# About Me

Hello! I'm Santhosh, a passionate and dedicated programmer with a deep interest in low level programming, scientific computing and computer vision. Currently, I'm actively involved with PyBaMM, an innovative organization at the forefront of battery modeling research and development.

# Interests

### My interest lies in:

- Low level programming: Writing C and using Linux makes me happy followed by the guilt of bloating things if I feel something could be more straighforward.
- Computer vision and deep learning: I love working with neural networks and deep learning algorithms!
- Scientific computing and research software: Leveraging tools for data analysis, simulations, and model development.

I'm constantly exploring new methodologies and technologies to enhance my work and contribute to especially if it's an open-source software.


# Personal Philosophy

I believe in the power of innovation and collaboration. By working together and pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible, we can create sustainable and impactful solutions for the future.


# Let's Connect

I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts, researchers, and contributors. Whether you want to discuss the latest advancements in technology, collaborate on a project, or simply share ideas, feel free to reach out!
